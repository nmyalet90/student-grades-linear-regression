# 🎓 Student Grades - Linear Regression

This repository contains a linear regression analysis performed in Python to predict student's final grades based on academic and personal variables.

## 📊 Project Description

Using a dataset with information about students (`student2.csv`), we built a simple linear regression model with `scikit-learn` to estimate the final grade. The goal is to understand how different factors influence academic performance.

### 📁 Dataset

The dataset student2.csv includes the following features:

- Id, Student_Age, Sex,High_School_Type, Scholarship, Additional_Work, Sports_activity, Transportation, Weekly_Study_Hours, Reading,Notes, Listening_in_Class, Project_work,Attendance
- Grade (target variable)

### ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

### 📈 Analysis Steps

1. Dataset loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and feature selection
3. Train-test split
4. Linear regression model training
5. Model evaluation using RMSE and R²
6. Visualization of predictions vs actual values
